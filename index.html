	<h1 class="parapgrah"> Welcome to my RSA project website </h1>
	<p class="parapgrah">
	You can navigate around the website and find each major feature of RSA and an example of how to use it, you may start
		in <a href="/Functions/generate.html">Generate</a> to generate yourself an RSA keypair. And then head over to the encryption section
		to make your first message, each section will explain what we are doing :D.
    <br>
    <br>
		On this website we are using a library called JSEncrypt which handels all Decryption, Encryption, Generation, Singing, Verifying
		and all other jobs related to handeling the RSA keys. And then using a few other smaller libraries such as crypto-js for smaller tasks like hashing.

	<h3 class="parapgrah"> Basics of RSA </h3>
	<p class="parapgrah">
		RSA is an asymetric encryption. On an easy to understand level, in Asymetric Encryption you have 2 keys. This goes for all asymetric encryption also including PGP and the like. You have a Public Key(PuK) and a Private Key(PrK). The Public key is as it's name states allowed to be completley public and out on the internet, for PGP for example it's quiet common to either use WKD(Web-Key-Directory) or Keyservers to distribute these public keys. The reason is that to compute the RSA or such standards PrK key from a sufficiently long key could take longer than the age of the universe to compute the PrK from the PuK. NIST in there May 2020 paper stated that an RSA key of a length of 2048 has a Security Strength of 112 bits which they classified as strong enough to secure classified documents.
