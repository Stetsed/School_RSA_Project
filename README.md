# School Website Project
Simple Website for School Project

This project is for my CS class, we have to make a simple website and as such I decided to play around with Cryptography, although basic. I found the JSEncrypt library and decided to add each of the functions it provided.

Each Page, excluding the homepage has 1 function for RSA, those functions being Encrypt, Decrypt, Sign/Verify and generating new RSA keys.

## How?

Each subpage in the website has a description of what we are doing in terms of JavaScript and if you view the HTML there are comment labeling what each function does.
